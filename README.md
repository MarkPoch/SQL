SQL_Projects
Welcome to the SQL_Projects repository! This repository showcases a collection of SQL projects that I have worked on, highlighting my skills in database management, query optimization, and data analysis. Each project folder contains the necessary SQL scripts, data files, and documentation to understand and reproduce the project's results.

Project List
Computer Store Database: Create and manage a database for a computer store, including inventory management, sales tracking, and reporting.

SuperBowl Database Advanced Query: Analyze a SuperBowl database and perform advanced queries to gain insights into team performance, player statistics, and game trends.

Feel free to explore each project folder to access the SQL scripts and accompanying files. Each project offers a unique demonstration of SQL application and showcases my abilities in working with databases.

If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please feel free to contact me as I am open to discussions, suggestions, and opportunities to expand my SQL skills.
